```
Given two strings, determine if they share a common substring. A substring may be as small as one character.
Example:
String1 = "art"
String 2 = "ammo"
Both string share 'a', so return true;
Example 2:
String1 = "be"
String 2 = "cat"
No characters are shared, so return false;
Bonus: Can you return the length of the longest substring shared by the two strings?
Example:
S1 = "wonderful"
S2 = "fulsome"
Both words share "ful", so return 3
